# About My Teaching

I enjoy teaching tremendously, and am deeply committed to helping my students in any way I can, whether discussing social science, medicine, public health, research methodology, or career plans. I am involved in teaching at all levels.

At the undergraduate level, I offer Sociology 126 – Health of the Public: Medicine and Disease in Social Context. This course examines the social causes and context of illness, death, and health care in the U.S. today; a syllabus is here. These lectures are podcast and are available on iTunes or here. From time to time, undergraduates also get involved in ongoing research projects as Research Assistants in my lab.

At the graduate level, I offer a seminar course on Biosocial Science (SOCY 636b), sit on dissertation committees, and involve graduate students and medical students in ongoing research projects in my lab. My sense is that, at this juncture, there is an important strand of social science research that is becoming large-scale, multi-disciplinary, and collaborative. Of course, this is a common model in biology, physics, and other sciences, but it is also increasingly becoming the case in the social sciences. I think that getting involved in such projects offers special opportunities to graduate students.

For example, students writing their dissertations while working on such projects derive several benefits: (1) they have the opportunity to be closely mentored by a faculty advisor and to learn both science and tradecraft; (2) they have the opportunity to contribute and influence the direction of the parent project, to feel the excitement of such research, and to continue to tap into it after they graduate, if they wish; and (3) they have the chance to make rapid and sophisticated progress, enabling them to publish papers which enhance their career prospects. Of course, I am also happy to serve as a dissertation advisor for students working on projects that are not part of our research group’s efforts.

At the post-doctoral level, I direct several extramurally funded programs that offer post-doctoral positions, focused on substantive and methodological topics related to networks, e.g., as part of our Program Project grant from NIA on “Networks and Neighborhoods”.

# Courses Offered
  
## SOM MGM 573: Network Interventions

**Course Description:** By exploring influential and cutting-edge research related to network science, this course will equip students with the tools they need to analyze problems related to phenomena as diverse as: product marketing, sustainability initiatives, financial market contagions, team assembly and performance, firm mergers, demand forecasting, and the spread of violence, infection, cooperation, rumors, innovation, or other phenomena.

An understanding of networks is crucial to leadership in entrepreneurial, business, government, or non-profit activities.  Leaders make decisions in an increasingly complex world defined by formal and informal networks – networks of employees and institutions, of collaborators and competitors, of patients and providers, of brands and customers.  Novel big-data technologies and computational techniques make this complexity visible and even manipulable.  Increasingly, we can intervene in networks to achieve public policy or management objectives.  Consequently, the topics and methods covered in the course are relevant to multiple management domains.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to both a theoretical perspective and a set of methodological techniques.  As a theoretical perspective, SNA stresses the interdependence among entities – such as customers, employees, investors, patients, doctors, brands, or NGOs – which can give rise to novel properties of the system.  SNA focuses on the relationships among interacting units and on how the interaction pattern (the architecture of connections, or the “topology”), or the spreading processes within the network (“contagion”), affect the behavior of the component entities and the system as a whole.  As a methodological approach, SNA refers to techniques steeped in graph theory, with statistical and computational applications.

We will explore both online and offline networks, and diverse applied topics like social capital, “big data” methods, AI manipulations, online community formation, tipping points, team performance, demand forecasting, information cascades, and others. The course concludes with a set of student presentations on the application of SNA in their organization, industry, or field of interest.
