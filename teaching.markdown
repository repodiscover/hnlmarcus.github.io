# About My Teaching

I enjoy teaching tremendously, and am deeply committed to helping my students in any way I can, whether discussing social science, medicine, public health, research methodology, or career plans. I am involved in teaching at all levels.

At the undergraduate level, I offer Sociology 126 – Health of the Public: Medicine and Disease in Social Context. This course examines the social causes and context of illness, death, and health care in the U.S. today; a syllabus is here. These lectures are podcast and are available on iTunes or here. From time to time, undergraduates also get involved in ongoing research projects as Research Assistants in my lab.

At the graduate level, I offer a seminar course on Biosocial Science (SOCY 636b), sit on dissertation committees, and involve graduate students and medical students in ongoing research projects in my lab. My sense is that, at this juncture, there is an important strand of social science research that is becoming large-scale, multi-disciplinary, and collaborative. Of course, this is a common model in biology, physics, and other sciences, but it is also increasingly becoming the case in the social sciences. I think that getting involved in such projects offers special opportunities to graduate students.

For example, students writing their dissertations while working on such projects derive several benefits: (1) they have the opportunity to be closely mentored by a faculty advisor and to learn both science and tradecraft; (2) they have the opportunity to contribute and influence the direction of the parent project, to feel the excitement of such research, and to continue to tap into it after they graduate, if they wish; and (3) they have the chance to make rapid and sophisticated progress, enabling them to publish papers which enhance their career prospects. Of course, I am also happy to serve as a dissertation advisor for students working on projects that are not part of our research group’s efforts.

At the post-doctoral level, I direct several extramurally funded programs that offer post-doctoral positions, focused on substantive and methodological topics related to networks, e.g., as part of our Program Project grant from NIA on “Networks and Neighborhoods.”.

# Courses Offered
  
### SOM MGT 573
## Network Interventions

**Course Description:** By exploring influential and cutting-edge research related to network science, this course will equip students with the tools they need to analyze problems related to phenomena as diverse as: product marketing, sustainability initiatives, financial market contagions, team assembly and performance, firm mergers, demand forecasting, and the spread of violence, infection, cooperation, rumors, innovation, or other phenomena.

An understanding of networks is crucial to leadership in entrepreneurial, business, government, or non-profit activities.  Leaders make decisions in an increasingly complex world defined by formal and informal networks – networks of employees and institutions, of collaborators and competitors, of patients and providers, of brands and customers.  Novel big-data technologies and computational techniques make this complexity visible and even manipulable.  Increasingly, we can intervene in networks to achieve public policy or management objectives.  Consequently, the topics and methods covered in the course are relevant to multiple management domains.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to both a theoretical perspective and a set of methodological techniques.  As a theoretical perspective, SNA stresses the interdependence among entities – such as customers, employees, investors, patients, doctors, brands, or NGOs – which can give rise to novel properties of the system.  SNA focuses on the relationships among interacting units and on how the interaction pattern (the architecture of connections, or the “topology”), or the spreading processes within the network (“contagion”), affect the behavior of the component entities and the system as a whole.  As a methodological approach, SNA refers to techniques steeped in graph theory, with statistical and computational applications.

We will explore both online and offline networks, and diverse applied topics like social capital, “big data” methods, AI manipulations, online community formation, tipping points, team performance, demand forecasting, information cascades, and others. The course concludes with a set of student presentations on the application of SNA in their organization, industry, or field of interest.

### SOM MGT 874
## Networks and Health

**Course description:** Decision-makers increasingly act in complex situations defined by formal and informal networks – networks of employees and institutions, of collaborators and competitors, of customers and brands, and of clients and providers.  Novel big-data technologies and computational techniques make this complexity visible and even manipulable.  Increasingly, we can intervene in networks to achieve public policy or management objectives.

We will explore new research and applications in network science, with an emphasis on health-related examples.  The material covered will particularly equip students with the tools they need to analyze problems in public health, global health, and medicine, and to be leaders of companies, entrepreneurial efforts, and policy-making related to health and health care.  But the topics and methods covered in the course are relevant to management topics in other industries, including marketing, forecasting, human resources, mergers, and so on.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to both a set of methodological techniques and a theoretical perspective.  As a methodological approach, SNA involves techniques steeped in graph theory, with statistical and computational applications.  As a theoretical perspective, SNA stresses the interdependence among entities – such as patients, doctors, or institutions.  SNA focuses on the relationships among interacting units and on how the interaction pattern (the architecture of connections, or the “topology”) affects the behavior of the component entities and the system as a whole.  Network structure can influence diverse outcomes: from technology adoption to group performance; from organizational mergers to firm relations; from brand awareness to consumer choice; from the spread of violence to the spread of infection.

We will explore both online and offline networks, and diverse applied topics like social capital, “big data” methods, online community formation, tipping points, team performance, demand forecasting, information cascades, online markets, and others.  And we will also have four in-class exercises using novel software to explore social network structure and function.

### Sociology 126
## Health of the Public: Medicine and Disease in Social Context

**Course Description:** This course examines the social causes and context of illness, death, longevity, and health care in the USA today. Who stays healthy and who falls ill? Who has a long life and who has a short one? What is a good death and why do so few Americans achieve it? What is good medical care, who gets it, and why? What role do physicians play in producing health in our society? To what extent do factors outside individuals’ control (factors such as genetics, geography, social networks, parental traits, or hospital quality) influence health and health care? Does socioeconomic inequality in society harm individual health? Do certain kinds of social networks or neighborhoods improve health? How do social factors get under our skin and literally become embodied? What are the collective constraints on individuals’ life prospects? What is the difference between an individualistic and a public health-oriented perspective on illness? And what issues of ethics and justice are raised by such questions? Would a different organization of society, different public expenditures, or different public policies matter? While exploring these questions, we will also consider how social scientists, biologists, epidemiologists, public health experts, and doctors address them—how they use theory to understand them and how they make “causal inferences” based on observational or experimental data. However, students are not expected to have in-depth knowledge of social science methods or statistics. The readings span the medical, public health, and social science literatures, and they reflect both qualitative and quantitative approaches. They also introduce new areas of “biosocial science” and techniques of “big data” as applied to health. In many ways, this course serves as an introduction to the field of public health.

### Sociology 554
## Human Nature Lab Workshop

[Schedule](http://humannaturelab.net/meetings-events/)

**Course Description:** This workshop is designed to be a continuous part of the graduate curriculum. Meeting weekly throughout both the fall and spring terms, it constitutes an ongoing, informal seminar dedicated to exploring fundamental properties of network science. Some work involves the use of large-scale, online experiments. Other work examines the biological determinants and consequences of social network interactions, with a particular emphasis on the genetic origins and implications of human network interactions. Ongoing investigations in the lab consider the biodemographic determinants of longevity and the genetic bases for human behaviors. The research discussed has implications for diverse behavioral interventions, and for clinical and policy maneuvers to prevent and treat illness. Discussions range widely among methodological, theoretical, empirical, and normative issues. Sessions alternate between presentations by students of their own work and by visitors. Contents of the workshop vary from term to term, and from year to year. Enrollment is open for credit to students who submit written work.

### Sociology 636b
### Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 636b
## Topics in Biosocial Science

**Course Description:** This graduate seminar (with limited enrollment, but open to anyone) will cover topics at the intersection of the natural and social sciences, including behavior genetics, gene-environment interactions, social epigenetics, and diverse other topics. We will focus on the ways in which our genes and our bodies are in a (short and long) conversation with our social environment. To what extent does our genetic makeup influence our behaviors? To what extent do our behaviors and social experiences influence our genes? To what extent do our genes increase or decrease our risk for particular outcomes given particular environmental exposures? What are the biological bases of resilience? And how does the social environment come to regulate our genome? How do social exposures reshape neural and endocrine processes? How do social exposures “get under our skin”? How are they literally embodied? This class is a topical seminar, meaning that the material covered each year will vary, and that it will be driven by student interest and fresh scientific discoveries. We are going to run this seminar jointly, and students will suggest topics, articles, critiques, and so on, at will. Students will also lead classes, and suggest topics and readings for those classes. As a result, the syllabus will likely change as the semester progresses. Each student will lead one or more classes (depending on enrollment and topics). A set of proposed topics and readings for the first part of the course is laid out below.
